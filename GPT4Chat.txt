Jason:
I have the following youtube video:  
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UOMDIukgq2s  
I want to piece together the content from 0-10 with the content from 13 through to the end of the video. Said another way, I want to splice out some bad words from 10-13. This video is not mine though, so I can't edit the video itself. using hashtags, and playlists, can I create a playlist with the video from 0-10 and the same video, but clipped 13-end, and with autoplay, make them look like one video I can share with the same link?

Bot:
Unfortunately, you cannot create a playlist with clipped portions of a single video on YouTube. Playlists can only contain full videos, and YouTube doesn't provide an option to set specific start and end times for individual videos within a playlist.

However, you can share the video with a specific start time by appending "?t=XX" at the end of the video URL (where XX is the number of seconds you want to start the video at). For example, if you want the video to start at 13 seconds, you can share this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOMDIukgq2s?t=13

But, this method doesn't allow you to remove the portion between 10-13 seconds and play the video seamlessly.

An alternative solution would be to download the video, edit it using a video editing software to remove the unwanted portion, and then upload the edited version to a platform that allows sharing edited content. Please make sure you have the necessary permissions to use and share the content before doing this.

Jason:
boo.. how about if we think of all the ways youtube allows you to control videos via a URL. Is there a way to use and share an embed link? Are there any other ways I am not familiar with that we could string together to get this done?

Bot:
Using an embedded link can help you achieve the desired result. You can use a custom HTML file to embed the video twice, with specific start and end times for each instance, and autoplay enabled to play them in sequence. Here's a step-by-step guide:
Create a new HTML file using a text editor, such as Notepad or Sublime Text.
Copy and paste the following code into the HTML file:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
    .video-container {  
        position: relative;  
        padding-bottom: 56.25%;  
        padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;  
    }  
    .video-container iframe,  
    .video-container object,  
    .video-container embed {  
        position: absolute;  
        top: 0;  
        left: 0;  
        width: 100%;  
        height: 100%;  
    }  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
  
<div class="video-container">  
    <iframe id="video1" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOMDIukgq2s?start=0&end=10&autoplay=1&controls=0&rel=0&disablekb=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  
    <iframe id="video2" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOMDIukgq2s?start=13&autoplay=1&controls=0&rel=0&disablekb=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="display:none;"></iframe>  
</div>  
  
<script>  
    document.getElementById("video1").addEventListener("ended", function(){  
        document.getElementById("video1").style.display = "none";  
        document.getElementById("video2").style.display = "block";  
    });  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>  
 
3. Replace "UOMDIukgq2s" in the code with the video ID of your desired video, if different.

Save the HTML file to your computer.
Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the embedded video with the specified start and end times.

Please note that this solution is for personal use and may not be suitable for sharing with a wide audience. To share the edited video, it is recommended to download, edit, and re-upload the video with the necessary permissions.

Jason:
hmmm this shows the first video, and plays it only until 10, which is the first part of the request, but the second piece of the video, from 13-end doesn't play. Is there any way to add some javascript to this that will mute the volume starting at 10, and then unmute the volume at 13?

Bot:
I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Unfortunately, YouTube's embedded player API does not have built-in functionality for muting and unmuting videos at specific times. However, you can use the YouTube Player API to achieve this. Here's an example of how you can create an HTML file that mutes the video at 10 seconds and unmutes it at 13 seconds:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
  <style>  
    .video-container {  
      position: relative;  
      padding-bottom: 56.25%;  
      padding-top: 30px;  
      height: 0;  
      overflow: hidden;  
    }  
    .video-container iframe,  
    .video-container object,  
    .video-container embed {  
      position: absolute;  
      top: 0;  
      left: 0;  
      width: 100%;  
      height: 100%;  
    }  
  </style>  
  <script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api"></script>  
</head>  
<body>  
  
<div class="video-container">  
  <div id="video"></div>  
</div>  
  
<script>  
  // Load the YouTube Player API  
  var player;  
  
  function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {  
    player = new YT.Player('video', {  
      height: '315',  
      width: '560',  
      videoId: 'UOMDIukgq2s',  
      events: {  
        'onReady': onPlayerReady,  
        'onStateChange': onPlayerStateChange  
      }  
    });  
  }  
  
  // Play the video when the player is ready  
  function onPlayerReady(event) {  
    event.target.playVideo();  
  }  
  
  // Monitor the video's playback state and mute/unmute as needed  
  function onPlayerStateChange(event) {  
    if (event.data === YT.PlayerState.PLAYING) {  
      muteAtTime(player, 10);  
      unmuteAtTime(player, 13);  
    }  
  }  
  
  // Mute the video at a specific time (in seconds)  
  function muteAtTime(player, time) {  
    setTimeout(function() {  
      player.mute();  
    }, time * 1000);  
  }  
  
  // Unmute the video at a specific time (in seconds)  
  function unmuteAtTime(player, time) {  
    setTimeout(function() {  
      player.unMute();  
    }, time * 1000);  
  }  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>  
 
Replace "UOMDIukgq2s" in the code with the video ID of your desired video, if different. Save the HTML file to your computer and open it in a web browser to view the embedded video with the specified mute and unmute times.

Jason:

This is good, but the video actually shows some bad stuff too that I want to skip over.... Maybe there's a way to skip from 10 to 13 with the youtube api?

Bot:
Yes, you can use the YouTube Player API to skip from 10 seconds to 13 seconds. Here's an example of how you can create an HTML file that skips the video from 10 seconds to 13 seconds:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
  <style>  
    .video-container {  
      position: relative;  
      padding-bottom: 56.25%;  
      padding-top: 30px;  
      height: 0;  
      overflow: hidden;  
    }  
    .video-container iframe,  
    .video-container object,  
    .video-container embed {  
      position: absolute;  
      top: 0;  
      left: 0;  
      width: 100%;  
      height: 100%;  
    }  
  </style>

  var player;  
  
  function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {  
    player = new YT.Player('video', {  
      height: '315',  
      width: '560',  
      videoId: 'UOMDIukgq2s',  
      events: {  
        'onReady': onPlayerReady,  
        'onStateChange': onPlayerStateChange  
      }  
    });  
  }  
  
  // Play the video when the player is ready  
  function onPlayerReady(event) {  
    event.target.playVideo();  
  }  
  
  // Monitor the video's playback state and skip as needed  
  function onPlayerStateChange(event) {  
    if (event.data === YT.PlayerState.PLAYING) {  
      skipFromTo(player, 10, 13);  
    }  
  }  
  
  // Skip the video from a specific start time to an end time (in seconds)  
  function skipFromTo(player, startTime, endTime) {  
    setTimeout(function() {  
      player.seekTo(endTime);  
    }, startTime * 1000);  
  }  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>  
 
Replace "UOMDIukgq2s" in the code with the video ID of your desired video, if different. Save the HTML file to your computer and open it in a web browser to view the embedded video with the specified skip time.

Jason:

Something weird is going on, the video skips over that part, but then around 22 seconds in, it goes back to 13 for some reason. Is there anything you overlooked?

Bot:
I apologize for the confusion. The issue is that the onPlayerStateChange event is triggered every time the video state changes, including when the video is skipped. To fix this, you can add a flag to ensure that the skip function is only called once:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
  <style>  
    .video-container {  
      position: relative;  
      padding-bottom: 56.25%;  
      padding-top: 30px;  
      height: 0;  
      overflow: hidden;  
    }  
    .video-container iframe,  
    .video-container object,

      width: '560',  
      videoId: 'UOMDIukgq2s',  
      events: {  
        'onReady': onPlayerReady,  
        'onStateChange': onPlayerStateChange  
      }  
    });  
  }  
  
  // Play the video when the player is ready  
  function onPlayerReady(event) {  
    event.target.playVideo();  
  }  
  
  // Monitor the video's playback state and skip as needed  
  function onPlayerStateChange(event) {  
    if (event.data === YT.PlayerState.PLAYING && !hasSkipped) {  
      skipFromTo(player, 10, 13);  
      hasSkipped = true;  
    }  
  }  
  
  // Skip the video from a specific start time to an end time (in seconds)  
  function skipFromTo(player, startTime, endTime) {  
    setTimeout(function() {  
      player.seekTo(endTime);

Replace "UOMDIukgq2s" in the code with the video ID of your desired video, if different. Save the HTML file to your computer and open it in a web browser to view the embedded video with the specified skip time.

Please note that this solution is for personal use and may not be suitable for sharing with a wide audience. To share the edited video, it is recommended to download, edit, and re-upload the video with the necessary permissions.

Jason:

And now, if I still wanted to skip from 10 to 13, but additionally wanted to skip from 19.75 to 21.75, is that possible?

Bot:
Yes, it is possible to skip multiple segments in the video. You can update the onPlayerStateChange event to include the additional skip segment, and use separate flags for each segment to ensure they are only skipped once. Here's the updated code:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
  <style>  
    .video-container {  
      position: relative;  
      padding-bottom: 56.25%;

      height: 0;  
      overflow: hidden;  
    }

  var hasSkipped1 = false;  
  var hasSkipped2 = false;  
  
  function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {  
    player = new YT.Player('video', {  
      height: '315',  
      width: '560',  
      videoId: 'UOMDIukgq2s',  
      events: {  
        'onReady': onPlayerReady,  
        'onStateChange': onPlayerStateChange  
      }  
    });  
  }  
  
  // Play the video when the player is ready  
  function onPlayerReady(event) {  
    event.target.playVideo();  
  }  
  
  // Monitor the video's playback state and skip as needed  
  function onPlayerStateChange(event) {  
    if (event.data === YT.PlayerState.PLAYING) {  
      if (!hasSkipped1) {  
        skipFromTo(player, 10, 13);  
        hasSkipped1 = true;  
      }  
      if (!hasSkipped2) {  
        skipFromTo(player, 19.75, 21.75);  
        hasSkipped2 = true;  
      }  
    }  
  }  
  
  // Skip the video from a specific start time to an end time (in seconds)  
  function skipFromTo(player, startTime, endTime) {  
    setTimeout(function() {  
      player.seekTo(endTime);  
    }, startTime * 1000);  
  }  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>  
 
Replace "UOMDIukgq2s" in the code with the video ID of your desired video, if different. Save the HTML file to your computer and open it in a web browser to view the embedded video with the specified skip times.

Jason:

This part looks like it is firing on every frame of the video playing, is that correct?   
if (event.data === YT.PlayerState.PLAYING) {    
      if (!hasSkipped1) {    
        skipFromTo(player, 10, 13);    
        hasSkipped1 = true;    
      }    
      if (!hasSkipped2) {    
        skipFromTo(player, 19.75, 21.75);    
        hasSkipped2 = true;    
      }    
    }    
If so, I wonder if YT has the time marker we are at, and should we be inspecting that? Also wondering if in the skipFromTo we need to times the endtime by 1000?

Bot:
You're correct that the onPlayerStateChange event is not the most optimal way to handle multiple skip segments, as it is triggered every time the player state changes. A better approach is to use the setInterval function to continuously check the current time of the video and skip the segments when the time reaches the desired point. Here's an updated version of the code:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
  <style>  
    .video-container {  
      position: relative;  
      padding-bottom: 56.25%;  
      padding-top: 30px;  
      height: 0;  
      overflow: hidden;  
    }  
    .video-container iframe,  
    .video-container object,

    player = new YT.Player('video', {  
      height: '315',  
      width: '560',  
      videoId: 'UOMDIukgq2s',  
      events: {  
        'onReady': onPlayerReady  
      }  
    });  
  }  
  
  // Play the video when the player is ready  
  function onPlayerReady(event) {  
    event.target.playVideo();  
    checkCurrentTime();  
  }  
  
  // Check the current time of the video and skip as needed  
  function checkCurrentTime() {  
    setInterval(function() {  
      var currentTime = player.getCurrentTime();  
      if (currentTime >= 10 && currentTime < 13) {  
        player.seekTo(13);  
      }  
      if (currentTime >= 19.75 && currentTime < 21.75) {  
        player.seekTo(21.75);  
      }  
    }, 100);  
  }

Replace "UOMDIukgq2s" in the code with the video ID of your desired video, if different. Save the HTML file to your computer and open it in a web browser to view the embedded video with the specified skip times.

Jason:

I'm going to try this out, but in the mean time, I am also wondering, if instead of skipping the video, could we do two things:  
1) Is there a way to "bleep" out certain timeframes in a video?  
2) Is there a way to put a black rectangle to block out part of the video image?

Bot:
Yes, you can achieve both "bleeping" out audio and covering a part of the video with a black rectangle using custom JavaScript and CSS. I've created an example below that demonstrates how to do this:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
  <style>  
    .video-container {  
      position: relative;  
      padding-bottom: 56.25%;  
      padding-top: 30px;  
      height: 0;  
      overflow: hidden;  
    }  
    .video-container iframe,  
    .video-container object,  
    .video-container embed {  
      position: absolute;  
      top: 0;  
      left: 0;  
      width: 100%;  
      height: 100%;  
    }  
    .blackout {  
      position: absolute;  
      background-color: black;  
      width: 50%;  
      height: 50%;  
      top: 25%;  
      left: 25%;  
      display: none;  
    }  
  </style>  
  <script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api"></script>  
</head>  
<body>  
  
<div class="video-container">  
  <div id="video"></div>  
  <div id="blackout" class="blackout"></div>  
</div>  
  
<script>  
  // Load the YouTube Player API  
  var player;  
  
  function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {  
    player = new YT.Player('video', {  
      height: '315',  
      width: '560',  
      videoId: 'UOMDIukgq2s',  
      events: {  
        'onReady': onPlayerReady  
      }  
    });  
  }  
  
  // Play the video when the player is ready  
  function onPlayerReady(event) {  
    event.target.playVideo();  
    applyCensorship();  
  }  
  
  // Apply censorship to the video (bleep audio and cover part of the video)  
  function applyCensorship() {  
    var blackoutElement = document.getElementById('blackout');  
    var bleepStart1 = 10;  
    var bleepEnd1 = 13;  
    var bleepStart2 = 19.75;  
    var bleepEnd2 = 21.75;  
    var blackoutStart = 10;  
    var blackoutEnd = 13;  
  
    setInterval(function() {  
      var currentTime = player.getCurrentTime();  
        
      // Bleep audio  
      if ((currentTime >= bleepStart1 && currentTime <= bleepEnd1) || (currentTime >= bleepStart2 && currentTime <= bleepEnd2)) {  
        player.mute();  
      } else {  
        player.unMute();  
      }  
        
      // Cover part of the video  
      if (currentTime >= blackoutStart && currentTime <= blackoutEnd) {  
        blackoutElement.style.display = 'block';  
      } else {  
        blackoutElement.style.display = 'none';  
      }  
    }, 100);  
  }  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>  
 
This code creates a black rectangle that covers the center of the video (you can adjust the size and position by modifying the .blackout CSS class) and mutes the audio during the specified timeframes. Replace "UOMDIukgq2s" in the code with the video ID of your desired video, if different. Save the HTML file to your computer and open it in a web browser to view the embedded video with the specified censorship.

Jason:

This is getting really good. Could of questions:  
1) instead of muting, can we play  the "bleeped" sound?  
2) can we split up the times for when we want to display the black box? The reason for this is that the censored audio plays for a much shorter time than the visual we want to censor plays for. 

Bot:

Yes, you can play a "bleep" sound instead of muting the audio, and you can also separate the time intervals for censoring the audio and displaying the black box. Here's the updated code:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
  <style>  
    .video-container {  
      position: relative;  
      padding-bottom: 56.25%;  
      padding-top: 30px;  
      height: 0;  
      overflow: hidden;  
    }  
    .video-container iframe,  
    .video-container object,  
    .video-container embed {  
      position: absolute;  
      top: 0;  
      left: 0;  
      width: 100%;  
      height: 100%;  
    }  
    .blackout {  
      position: absolute;  
      background-color: black;  
      width: 50%;  
      height: 50%;  
      top: 25%;  
      left: 25%;  
      display: none;  
    }  
  </style>  
  <script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api"></script>  
</head>  
<body>  
  
<div class="video-container">  
  <div id="video"></div>  
  <div id="blackout" class="blackout"></div>  
</div>  
  
<audio id="bleep" src="bleep.mp3" preload="auto"></audio>  
  
<script>  
  // Load the YouTube Player API  
  var player;  
  
  function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {  
    player = new YT.Player('video', {  
      height: '315',  
      width: '560',  
      videoId: 'UOMDIukgq2s',  
      events: {  
        'onReady': onPlayerReady  
      }  
    });  
  }  
  
  // Play the video when the player is ready  
  function onPlayerReady(event) {  
    event.target.playVideo();  
    applyCensorship();  
  }  
  
  // Apply censorship to the video (bleep audio and cover part of the video)  
  function applyCensorship() {  
    var blackoutElement = document.getElementById('blackout');  
    var bleepAudio = document.getElementById('bleep');  
  
    var bleepStart1 = 10;  
    var bleepEnd1 = 13;  
    var bleepStart2 = 19.75;  
    var bleepEnd2 = 21.75;  
  
    var blackoutStart = 10;  
    var blackoutEnd = 15;  
  
    setInterval(function() {  
      var currentTime = player.getCurrentTime();  
        
      // Play bleep sound  
      if ((currentTime >= bleepStart1 && currentTime <= bleepEnd1) || (currentTime >= bleepStart2 && currentTime <= bleepEnd2)) {  
        player.mute();  
        bleepAudio.currentTime = 0;  
        bleepAudio.play();  
      } else {  
        player.unMute();  
      }  
        
      // Display black box  
      if (currentTime >= blackoutStart && currentTime <= blackoutEnd) {  
        blackoutElement.style.display = 'block';  
      } else {  
        blackoutElement.style.display = 'none';  
      }  
    }, 100);  
  }  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>  
 
Replace "UOMDIukgq2s" in the code with the video ID of your desired video, if different. Additionally, replace "bleep.mp3" with the actual path to the bleep sound file you want to use. Save the HTML file to your computer and open it in a web browser to view the embedded video with the specified censorship.

OK, I just tried creating a link to this page running on my local machine, and the censorship stopped working. When it was working I was accessing the page from C:\temp\page.html Now that I am trying to access it from \\My-Machine\C$\temp\page.html the censorship has stopped working

Bot:
The issue you are facing is likely related to security restrictions imposed by web browsers when accessing local files or resources. When accessing the page from \\My-Machine\C$\temp\page.html, the browser treats it as a different domain, which may cause restrictions on loading external resources or running JavaScript.

To resolve this issue, you can host the HTML file on a local web server, which will allow the browser to treat it as a normal web page. You can set up a simple local web server using Python or Node.js.

Using Python:
Open a command prompt or terminal.

Navigate to the directory containing the HTML file (e.g., cd C:\temp).

Run one of the following commands based on your Python version:

For Python 2.x: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

For Python 3.x: python -m http.server 8000
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/page.html.

Using Node.js:
Install the http-server package globally using npm:

npm install -g http-server  
 
2. Open a command prompt or terminal.

Navigate to the directory containing the HTML file (e.g., cd C:\temp).

Run the following command:

http-server -p 8000  
 
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/page.html.

By hosting the HTML file on a local web server, you should be able to access the page and its features without encountering the security restrictions imposed by the browser.
